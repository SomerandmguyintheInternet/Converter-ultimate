Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/SomerandmguyintheInternet/Converter-ultimate.git](https://github.com/SomerandmguyintheInternet/Converter-ultimate.git)
cd Converter-ultimate

Create & Activate a Virtual Environment: This is crucial to avoid conflicts.

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

Install the Installer's GUI Prerequisite:

pip install PyQt6

Run the Installer/Builder Script: This command starts the process of installing dependencies, downloading the app.py source, building the final .exe, and creating shortcuts.

python runtime.py

Project Internals
This repository uses a two-script system to create a robust and seamless user experience.

runtime.py (The Smart Installer)
This script is the user-facing installer. Its job is not to be the application, but to build and deploy it. It handles dependency checking, downloads the latest application source, packages it into a final .exe using PyInstaller, and creates all necessary system shortcuts. It also serves as the uninstaller.

app.py (The Core Application)
This is the actual file conversion tool. The installer downloads this file and compiles it into the final Converter-Ultimate.exe that users interact with. It contains all the UI, conversion logic, and feature integrations.
